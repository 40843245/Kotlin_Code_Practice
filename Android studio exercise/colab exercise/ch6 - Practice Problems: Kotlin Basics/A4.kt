/*
1. Can you determine the output of this program before you run the code in Kotlin Playground? 
Yes

The original code

```
fun main() {
    val numberOfAdults = "20"
    val numberOfKids = "30"
    val total = numberOfAdults + numberOfKids
    println("The total party size is: $total")
}
```

will be rendered as 

```
The total party size is: 2030
```

2. Can you find the issue in the code and fix it so that it prints this output?
Yes, see the following code
*/

fun main() {
    val numberOfAdults = 20
    val numberOfKids = 30
    val total = numberOfAdults + numberOfKids
    println("The total party size is: $total")
}
